## My Buddy Web Challenge

This repository represent my answer to [myb-web-challenge](https://github.com/moveyourbuddy/myb-web-challenge).

The goal is to build a React web app to see the profile of a Player.

### Installation

To install the project you can use yarn or npm 
```
yarn install
// or
npm install
```

### Running the app

Same here, you can use yarn or npm to run the web app
```
yarn start
// or
npm start
```

*This may not be the definitive version, there are still some bugs to correct.*
